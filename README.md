# HiFi-GAN-LSR-RT: Generative Adversarial Networks for Efficient and High Fidelity Speech Synthesis,
# Low Sample Rate, Real-Time version

This is a derivative of excellent work by Jungil Kong, Jaehyeon Kim, Jaekyoung Bae
here [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05646) and their training code with some
modification to the vocoder and training methods to make it more real-time.

The aim is to train and release 100% Open-Source vocoder models for 16kHz and
8kHz output along with appropriate Generator model that are usable with SpeechT5
models by Microsoft and others.
